A tool to track the performance of your network

I made this repo for my capstone PLTW Engineering course to collect data on network performance degradation due to inadequate cooling systems found in consumer routers, modems, APs, swtiches, etc.

If you would like to help with data collection, share personal testimonials about your equipment overheating and underperforming, your janky solutions to fix it, ideas our team should consider, or anything related to the stated issue, please open a new issue or comment on an existing one! 

More stuff to come...
